# online-store
The goal of this project is to create a simple and responsive online store using Flutter (Dart). This store will allow users to browse products, view detailed product information, add items to a shopping cart, and proceed to a (dummy) checkout. It serves as a foundational project for learning Flutter app development with practical state management.
